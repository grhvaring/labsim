# Numerical Simulation Laboratory 2021

This repository contains the solutions I worked out for the excercises assigned in the Numerical Simulation Laboratory (NSL) class I attended in the summer semester of 2021.

Each lab session consists of number of excercises to solve, some of them pretty "heavy" on the machine, for this reason the solutions are divided in two main blocks:
- a `C++` program for the most computationally expensive part of the excercise, located in the directory `lab_x/src/`, which outputs its results to files located in `results/lab_x/`
- a jupyter notebook, located in the directory `notebooks/` and containing the assignements together with my solutions and possible remarks.

## Visualization

The jupyter notebooks can be viewed easily in-browser from GitHub itself, and contain the presentation of each problem followed by the strategy I employed to solve it and finally a visual representation of the results I got, occasionally with my own thoughts and conclusions.

The complete `C++` solutions are not explained in detail in the notebooks, but if needed, all the source files are present in the repository, organized by lab session.
